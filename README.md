In this Regression Analysis in Excel project, I worked with data from a company in the e-commerce sector, The Trendy Shopper—a fast-growing e-commerce business that offers a diverse selection of contemporary products across various categories, including fashion, electronics, and home decor.
The company has a broad customer base and a wide range of products. However, the enterprise is unsure about the impact of product prices and discounts on customers’ spending, which hampers its ability to create an effective pricing strategy to maximize sales and profits.
It currently uses a one-size-fits-all marketing approach. But given the diversity in the customer base and the wide range of products, there may be more effective approaches. That's why The Trendy Shopper aims to leverage its transactional data to understand how factors (product prices, quantity purchases, discounts) affect overall expenditure by utilizing predictive modeling (simple and multiple linear regression).
Therefore, my task was to help the company optimize its pricing and discount strategies, potentially increasing sales and customer satisfaction.
